# Badminton Session Management UI - Phase 1

This document provides an overview of the UI implementation for Phase 1 of the Badminton Session Management system.

## Pages Implemented

### Home Page

- Modern landing page with hero section, features, and getting started guides
- Navigation to host and player interfaces
- Path: `/src/app/page.tsx`

### Host Interface

1. **Host Dashboard**

   - Overview of active sessions
   - Ability to create new sessions
   - Session history view
   - Path: `/src/app/host/page.tsx`

2. **Create Session**

   - Form to configure a new badminton session
   - Fields for session name, courts, duration, player limits, etc.
   - Path: `/src/app/host/new/page.tsx`

3. **Session Management**
   - Session details and status
   - Tabs for Players, Courts, Waiting Queue, and Match History
   - Controls for starting/ending the session
   - Path: `/src/app/host/sessions/[id]/page.tsx`

### Player Interface

1. **Join Session**

   - Form to join a session using session ID and player number
   - Path: `/src/app/join/page.tsx`

2. **Confirm Details**

   - Form to confirm personal details
   - Fields for name, gender, skill level, phone
   - Path: `/src/app/join/confirm/page.tsx`

3. **Player Status**
   - Live view of player's status (waiting, playing, finished)
   - Queue position and wait time
   - Auto-refreshing interface
   - Path: `/src/app/join/status/page.tsx`

## Components

### Player Components

- `AddPlayerForm`: Form for adding players to a session
- `PlayerCard`: Card displaying player details
- `PlayerList`: Grid layout of player cards
- Path: `/src/components/player/player-components.tsx`

### Court Components

- `CourtCard`: Card displaying court status and current match
- `CourtList`: Grid layout of court cards
- `SelectPlayersModal`: Modal for selecting players for a court
- Path: `/src/components/court/court-components.tsx`

## UI Features

1. Responsive design for all screen sizes
2. Tab-based navigation for complex interfaces
3. Real-time status indicators for players and courts
4. Form validation for data entry
5. Visual feedback for waiting times and queue positions

## Integration with API

The UI components are designed to integrate with the existing API endpoints defined in `/src/lib/api.ts`.

Current implementation uses mock data for demonstration, but the components are structured to easily connect to the real API when ready.

## Next Steps

1. Connect UI components to actual API endpoints
2. Implement authentication for host
3. Add real-time updates using websockets (Phase 2)
4. Enhance error handling and loading states
5. Add animations and transitions for better UX
